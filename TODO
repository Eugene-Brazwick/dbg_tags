  Tag.enable x: :err

  also enables generic: :trc
  WHY? This is confusing???

  ALSO:     Tag.enable :val
  sets generic to :trc, but then does trc: :val.

  Since we can say Tag.trc 'bla'
  I also expect Tag.enable :trc
  to work...

DONE 0003 2022-03-25. 
  gem description loses newlines on rubygem.org. This is STUPID!
  Must be shorter, or fixed.

fixed 0004 2023-08-13 A nested Tag.enable should not lower the level of an
  outer one.
  Tag.enable system: :dtl do
    .....

    Tag.enable system: :err do
      # should still be detail!
    end
  end
  Examples. Put Tag.enable :dtl on top of _spec file.
  Then individual examples that have Tag.enable :nil .... 
  will remain silent which is not the intention.
  If they RAISE the level it will be fine though.
  NOTE: raise version of gem as this is kind of incompatible...
  Can make it remain compatible and more clear and more flexible:
  Tag.enable system: '>=err'
  ``Make sure the tag level is >= err here''
  I am a genious, after all.
